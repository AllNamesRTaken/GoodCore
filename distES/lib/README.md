Good Core typescript library compiled to ES6 with utility functions and effective data structures for use with both Node and browser.

## This is just an ES6 compile from the goodcore library to make tree shaking easier for ES6 projects.

# Caveat
Iterator support in List and SortedList requires that the browser supports it too. So if you have to support a browser which do not such as IE11 then please use a polyfill like core.js. 

# Examples
Here is a small example that makes no sense other than show what the lib looks like in use.
